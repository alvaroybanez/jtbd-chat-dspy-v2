   - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line)
   - Character count display for long messages
   - Disabled states during streaming

4. **TypingIndicator Component** (`src/components/chat/TypingIndicator.tsx`)
   - Animated typing dots for streaming responses
   - Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions
   - Visual feedback during assistant response generation

5. **ContextLoader Component** (`src/components/chat/ContextLoader.tsx`)
   - Loading states for context retrieval operations
   - Progress indication for long-running operations
   - Status messages for different loading phases

6. **PickerInterface Component** (`src/components/chat/PickerInterface.tsx`)
   - Multi-select interfaces for insights, metrics, JTBDs
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Visual selection feedback with checkboxes
   - Batch selection/deselection operations

### Streaming Infrastructure

1. **useSSE Hook** (`src/hooks/useSSE.ts`)
   - Custom React hook for Server-Sent Events
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Support for POST requests with SSE responses
   - Chunk parsing and message handling

2. **Stream Type System** (`src/types/chat.ts`)
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for streaming
   - ChatStreamChunk for incremental updates
   - StreamingState for connection management
   - ContextData and PickerData for structured responses

### Key Features Delivered

#### Real-time Streaming
- **Server-Sent Events**: Full SSE implementation for real-time updates
- **Incremental Rendering**: Messages appear word-by-word as they stream
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection on network issues
- **Stream Control**: Ability to stop streaming mid-response

#### Message Rendering
- **Markdown Support**: Full markdown rendering with GFM extensions
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **Link Processing**: Clickable links with proper formatting
- **List Formatting**: Ordered and unordered lists
- **Table Support**: Markdown tables with proper styling

#### Loading States
- **Typing Indicators**: Animated dots during response generation
- **Context Loading**: Visual feedback during data retrieval
- **Progress Updates**: Status messages for long operations
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with retry options

#### User Experience
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatic scrolling to new messages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and screen reader support

### Technical Implementation

#### SSE Connection Flow
1. User sends message via MessageInput
2. ChatContainer initiates SSE connection to `/api/v1/chat`
3. useSSE hook manages connection lifecycle
4. Stream chunks processed and rendered incrementally
5. TypingIndicator shown during streaming
6. Connection closed on completion or error

#### Message State Management
```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system'
  content: string
  timestamp: Date
  metadata?: {
    intent?: string
    context?: ContextData
    picker?: PickerData
    streaming?: boolean
  }
}
```

#### Stream Processing
- Chunks arrive as `data: {type, content, metadata}`
- Content accumulated in state for incremental display
- Metadata updates trigger UI state changes
- Error chunks handled with user-friendly messages

### User Experience Flow

1. **Message Sending**: User types message and presses Enter
2. **Streaming Start**: SSE connection established with server
3. **Typing Indicator**: Animated dots appear during processing
4. **Incremental Display**: Response streams in word-by-word
5. **Markdown Rendering**: Content formatted with markdown support
6. **Completion**: Stream ends, typing indicator disappears
